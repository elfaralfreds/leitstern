# Datastar and FastEndpoints example

## What is Datastar?

Datastar is a lightweight hypermedia framework that brings reactive functionality to server-rendered applications. It combines the best of both worlds:

 - The simplicity and reliability of server-side rendering
 - The dynamic, reactive user experience in the style of a Single Page Application (SPA) but with very little to no JavaScript

## This repository

While looking into .Net Core and Datastar, I found that there were very few examples of using Datastar with FastEndpoints. So I decided to take a run at it. During the process I stumbled across a few useful repositories from other authors taking a run at implementing Datastar with dotnet in different UI frameworks.

### Demo

Current state ( should be ) running here: https://datastar-fastendpoints-demo.fly.dev/

### Run locally

Go to `src/FastDatastar`

Run following command to initialize package managers
> npm run init
( *Will run `dotnet restore` and `npm install` concurrently* )

*Run following command to start*
> npm run dev

( *Will run `dotnet watch run` and `tailwind css cli` concurrently* )

More details for commands in the package.json

## Goals

 - [x] .NET 9 API with hot-reload
 - [x] Implement FastEndpoints
 - [x] Implement .liquid templates for UI
    - Liquid was originally created by Shopify as a secure and customizable template language for web content. Designed to empower users to modify storefronts safely, it has since become widely adopted in various web frameworks and static site generators.

 - [x] Implement Tailwind CSS for styling
    - Currently using Tailwind CSS 4. `npm run dev` will start both `dotnet watch run` and the tailwind cli in watch mode.

 - [x] Implement Datastar
 - [ ] Authentication and authorization using Auth0
 - [ ] Redirect to Auth0 login page from endpoint
    - If a endpoint is protected by authentication, the user will be redirected to the Auth0 login page. After successful login, the user will be redirected back to the original page.

 - [x] Anonymous routes
 - [x] 404 UI if endpoint is not found
 - [ ] Better error handling
 - [x] Deploy demo to Fly.io

### Future nice-to-haves
 - [x] Tailwind part of hot-reload
    - When changes are made to the .liquid templates, the tailwind CSS is recompiled and hot-reloaded in the browser. This allows for a fast development experience without having to refresh the page.

 - [ ] Hot-reload FastEndpoints endpoints registration if path has changed
 - [ ] Navigation context inside .liquid templates
 - [x] Datastar SSE fragments using .liquid
    - Could be valueable to have the navigation context inside the .liquid templates. This would allow for a more dynamic and reactive user experience.

 - [ ] Datastar SSE fragments using .liquid template inline?
 - [ ] Inline-.liquid code in FastEndpoints endpoint?
 - [ ] Look into best practices for FastEndpoints project structure
 - [ ] 404 UI endpoint should return a 404 status code

### Other repositories

**"RickTheHat/DatastarExamples"**

Base for my repo is from his "DatastarExamples" repository. It is a collection of examples of using Datastar with different frameworks and languages. The examples are not all working, but they are a good starting point for learning how to use Datastar with different frameworks.
